+++</p> <p>If you’ve ever used <a href=""><em>Arch Linux</em></a> or one of its derivatives then you’ve most likely heard of and potentially used the Arch User Repository, or <a href=""><em>AUR</em></a> for short. It’s an awesome community driven space to share your programs in an <strong>unofficial</strong> way that means that they can be more easily installed on Arch, without having to get them on the main repos. Because it’s a user space where <strong>anyone</strong> can upload their packages, it opens the door to malware which may, for a short time, go unnoticed. And, that’s exactly what happened a couple months ago. There were a number of compromised packages that were uploaded to the AUR. These were labelled as patches and pre-compiled binaries that an unsuspecting user may install thinking it’s a legitimate package. These packages were removed relatively quickly but not before some users managed to install them.</p> <p>After the removal of all the compromised packages, things were fine for a little bit. That was until the AUR, and the Arch site in general, started experiencing <a href="">DDoS</a> attacks. It’s unclear who the DDoSes are from but it’s safe to assume that the bad actors who uploaded the malware wanted some form of revenge.</p>`,1);function d(e,t){const a=h(t,["children","$$slots","$$events","$$legacy"]);p(e,l(()=>a,{children:(o,c)=>{var r=m();s(4),i(o,r)},$$slots:{default:!0}}))}const v=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:d},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}));export{v as _,d as a};
