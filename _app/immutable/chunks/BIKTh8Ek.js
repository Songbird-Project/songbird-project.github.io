+++</p> <p>About a year ago I streamed for the very first time. The topic of that stream was the <a href=""><em>Fish</em></a> shell. The [VOD] is still available to watch, but I absolutely wouldn’t recommend it. After that short experience with the shell I decided to just stick with my tried and tested <a href=""><em>Zsh</em></a>.</p> <p>Since then, Fish has gone through a couple version changes and even a full Rust rewrite. So, I thought it would be a fitting time to take another look at it.</p> <!> <p>Although I already had my first impressions with the shell when I initially tried it, I don’t remember any specific things that stuck in my mind.
