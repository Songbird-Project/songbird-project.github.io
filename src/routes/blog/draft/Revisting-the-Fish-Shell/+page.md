About a year ago I streamed for the very first time. The topic of that stream was the [*Fish*]() shell. The [VOD] is still available to watch, but I absolutely wouldn't recommend it. After that short experience with the shell I decided to just stick with my tried and tested [*Zsh*]().

Since then, Fish has gone through a couple version changes and even a full Rust rewrite. So, I thought it would be a fitting time to take another look at it.

## First *Second* Impressions

Although I already had my first impressions with the shell when I initially tried it, I don't remember any specific things that stuck in my mind. So, trying it again was like seeing something familiar yet completely new.
