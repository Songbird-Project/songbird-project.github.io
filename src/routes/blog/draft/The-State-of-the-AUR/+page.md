If you've ever used [*Arch Linux*]() or one of its derivatives then you've most likely heard of and potentially used the Arch User Repository, or [*AUR*]() for short. It's an awesome community driven space to share your programs in an **unofficial** way that means that they can be more easily installed on Arch, without having to get them on the main repos. Because it's a user space where **anyone** can upload their packages, it opens the door to malware which may, for a short time, go unnoticed. And, that's exactly what happened a couple months ago. There were a number of compromised packages that were uploaded to the AUR. These were labelled as patches and pre-compiled binaries that an unsuspecting user may install thinking it's a legitimate package. These packages were removed relatively quickly but not before some users managed to install them.

After the removal of all the compromised packages, things were fine for a little bit. That was until the AUR, and the Arch site in general, started experiencing [DDoS]() attacks. It's unclear who the DDoSes are from but it's safe to assume that the bad actors who uploaded the malware wanted some form of revenge.
